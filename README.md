This project detects motion using opencv

Whenever motion isnt detected for more than 10 ms the screen dims and once it detects motion it increases the brightness once again

The brightness is changed using apple script

This could potentially help in preserving battery life but the main purpose is to hide one's work while they are not working.

Project idea by Reddit: u/LAcuber

For this to work you must start the program while sitting in front of the camera.
